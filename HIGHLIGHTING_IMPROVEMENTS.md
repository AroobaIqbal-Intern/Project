# Highlighting System Improvements

## Problem Identified

Your chatbot was providing correct answers but highlighting the wrong sentences in the paper. This happened because:

1. **Poor phrase extraction**: The system was extracting random 3-8 word phrases instead of meaningful content
2. **No semantic matching**: It only looked for exact text matches
3. **Irrelevant highlighting**: Highlighted phrases that didn't represent the actual source of the answer

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Improved Phrase Extraction**
- **Before**: Random 3-8 word phrases from sentences
- **After**: Complete sentences or meaningful clauses that actually contain the answer

```python
# Old approach - random phrases
for i in range(len(words) - 2):
    for j in range(3, min(9, len(words) - i + 1)):
        phrase = ' '.join(words[i:i+j])

# New approach - meaningful content
if len(words) >= 8:
    if len(sentence) < 150:
        phrases.append(sentence)  # Use complete sentence
    else:
        # Split long sentences at natural break points
        parts = re.split(r'[,;]', sentence)
        for part in parts:
            if 20 < len(part) < 120:
                phrases.append(part)
```

### 2. **Better Content Selection**
- **Complete sentences**: Use full sentences when they're meaningful
- **Natural break points**: Split at commas and semicolons for better context
- **Length optimization**: Focus on content that's neither too short nor too long
- **Important word detection**: Look for content around key terms like "study", "found", "results"

### 3. **Multiple Matching Strategies**
- **Exact match**: Try to find the exact phrase first
- **Fuzzy matching**: Use Levenshtein distance for similar text
- **Semantic similarity**: Find text with high word overlap (50%+)

### 4. **Debug and Transparency**
- **Source content display**: Shows exactly what content the RAG engine used
- **Console logging**: Detailed information about what's being highlighted
- **Phrase validation**: Only highlight meaningful content (20+ characters)

## How It Works Now

### 1. **Question Asked**
```
User: "What are the main findings of this paper?"
```

### 2. **RAG Engine Response**
- Finds relevant content chunks
- Generates answer based on those chunks
- Prepares highlighting data with meaningful phrases

### 3. **Improved Highlighting**
- Extracts complete sentences or meaningful clauses
- Uses multiple matching strategies to find the right text
- Highlights the actual content that was used for the answer

### 4. **Source Content Display**
- Shows the exact chunks used by the RAG engine
- Displays the phrases that were highlighted
- Provides transparency about what content influenced the answer

## Expected Results

### **Before Improvements**
- ❌ Random phrases highlighted
- ❌ Wrong sentences annotated
- ❌ No way to see what content was used
- ❌ Poor user experience

### **After Improvements**
- ✅ Meaningful content highlighted
- ✅ Correct sentences annotated
- ✅ Source content visible
- ✅ Better user understanding

## Testing the Improvements

### 1. **Run the Test Command**
```bash
python manage.py test_highlighting
```

### 2. **Ask Questions in Chatbot**
- Ask specific questions about the paper
- Check if the highlighted content matches the answer
- View the source content display

### 3. **Check Console Output**
- Look for detailed logging about phrase extraction
- See which matching strategy succeeded
- Verify the highlighted content

## Example of Improved Highlighting

### **Question**: "What is this paper about?"

### **Old System**
- Might highlight: "the paper about machine learning"
- Random 3-4 word phrase that doesn't give context

### **New System**
- Highlights: "This paper presents a comprehensive review of machine learning applications in educational settings."
- Complete sentence that actually answers the question

## Troubleshooting

### **If Highlighting Still Seems Wrong**

1. **Check the source content display** - See exactly what content was used
2. **Look at console logs** - Verify phrase extraction and matching
3. **Test with simple questions** - Start with basic questions to verify the system
4. **Check paper content quality** - Poor text extraction can still cause issues

### **Common Issues**

1. **No highlights appear**: Content might not contain the expected phrases
2. **Wrong content highlighted**: The RAG engine might be using different chunks than expected
3. **Poor text quality**: PDF extraction issues can still affect highlighting

## Future Improvements

1. **Semantic similarity**: Use embeddings to find similar content
2. **Context awareness**: Consider surrounding sentences for better highlighting
3. **User feedback**: Allow users to correct highlighting mistakes
4. **Machine learning**: Train models to identify the most relevant content

## Conclusion

The highlighting system has been significantly improved to:

- **Highlight meaningful content** instead of random phrases
- **Use multiple matching strategies** for better accuracy
- **Provide transparency** about what content was used
- **Focus on complete thoughts** rather than fragments

Your chatbot should now highlight the correct sentences that actually contain the information used to answer questions!
