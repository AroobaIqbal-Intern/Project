# 🚀 Pull Request: Automatic Paper Download System

## 📋 **PR Summary**

**Title:** Implement Automatic Paper Download System with Recursive Reference Extraction

**Type:** Feature Enhancement

**Priority:** High

**Breaking Changes:** No

---

## 🎯 **Problem Statement**

The existing system had a critical limitation where referenced papers would not show content in the browser, creating a recursive problem:

- **Main paper upload worked** ✅
- **Reference papers showed "Paper content not available"** ❌
- **Recursive issue** when clicking on reference papers ❌
- **Chatbot couldn't answer questions** from referenced papers ❌

This severely limited the system's usefulness for academic research and paper analysis.

---

## 🚀 **Solution Overview**

Implemented a comprehensive automatic paper download system that:

1. **Automatically downloads referenced papers** from multiple online sources
2. **Recursively extracts references** from downloaded papers (up to 3 levels deep)
3. **Creates a complete reference network** where all papers show full content
4. **Enables chatbot to answer questions** from the entire paper network
5. **Provides real-time progress tracking** and user-friendly interface

---

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Core Components Added:**

#### **1. Paper Downloader (`papers/paper_downloader.py`)**
```python
class PaperDownloader:
    """Downloads academic papers from various sources."""
    
    def download_paper(self, paper: Paper) -> bool:
        # Tries multiple sources: arXiv, DOI, Semantic Scholar, ResearchGate, Google Scholar
        # Handles different file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
        # Stores files in organized directory structure
```

#### **2. Recursive Reference Extractor**
```python
class RecursiveReferenceExtractor:
    """Extracts references recursively from papers."""
    
    def process_uploaded_paper(self, paper: Paper) -> List[Paper]:
        # Processes uploaded paper with RAG engine
        # Extracts references and downloads them
        # Recursively processes downloaded papers
        # Returns list of all downloaded papers
```

#### **3. Enhanced Upload Process**
```python
# Background processing starts automatically
def process_paper_background():
    downloaded_papers = recursive_extractor.process_uploaded_paper(paper)
    print(f"Downloaded {len(downloaded_papers)} papers")

thread = threading.Thread(target=process_paper_background)
thread.start()
```

### **Download Sources Supported:**
1. **arXiv** - Preprints and published papers
2. **DOI** - Direct publisher links
3. **Semantic Scholar** - Academic search engine
4. **ResearchGate** - Academic social network
5. **Google Scholar** - General academic search
